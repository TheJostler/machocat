Haha I thought you'd like that! Perhaps the salt looks like a sha256 hash, we continually chain sha256 hashes of the salt in order to generate sudo random data of equal length to the OTP key, we then encrypt the OTP key with the random data in order to generate a derived key which is statistically random. This would make our derived key resistant against statistical analysis attacks.
